Print quality is excellent and print speed is reasonable. I have been able to scan and print on legal size paper also, though this size is not specifically listed in the specs. So far, duplex printing has not worked well. Paper gets jammed at time of turn-around to print the second page. I suspect this is due to the quality of paper available here in India. I have not tried it on a large variety of papers, so I am hoping I will find suitable paper that will allow for duplex printing automatically. Currently, I am manually turning around the paper to print on the reverse side. Hence, I have dropped one star from the overall rating.",0.4819940476190476,0.23058035714285718,pos

It has been one of the best decisions that I have taken. In typical Amazon fashion, the delivery was smooth and timely. I setup up the printer easily but after a few days noticed that the printer was not responding to print commands. I placed a service request with Epson Service Centre, in less than 24hours, a technician visited my house, installed the appropriate printer driver (I had chosen a broader one) and solved the issue! The print quality is fantastic, whether for home or for small office, this is a very good choice, indeed! Go for it! üëç",0.5666666666666667,0.3770833333333333,pos

There was none sent to me on my MacAir, none to my email address and none to my mobile ... how could they when I had not even set it up? So... couldn't continue.Thirdly, I went to the website given in the manual - ij.start.canon ... useless. The model number is not even present.Fourthly, went to the Canon India website ... again no model. The closest was E4270 while the printer that I purchased was E4200. Downloaded the driver & wifi setup ... went through the procedure ... THOUGH LUCK!!!Fifthly, wanted to return it ... couldn't; the option for return was not available ... I had to book a ""SERVICE CALL"" for someone to come and set it up for me.MORE SURPRISE ... the technician called up asking for directions and finally never came. When I called him way past the allotted service time, I was told to send a video of the printer because it was a connectivity issue and the only way to rectify it was to get a replacement for which he needed the video.I have sent the video and as I waiting, I got a mail saying that your service call has been completed ... please rate the same ...I am at loss of words.All that I want now is to return the product and for the seller to return my money!!!!",0.2425925925925926,-0.011111111111111108,pos

liked product merit demerit well first priter easy use need laptop computer priting scanning use mobile phone printing scanning take time get settle take time usual printing computer laptop cartridge ink costly get black cartridge r amazon colour cartridge opinion average product good product price,I liked the product but it has some merits and demerits as well first of all priter is easy to use and does not need any laptop and computer for priting and scanning you can use your mobile phone for printing and scanning. It takes time to get settle down take more time than usual if you are printing through computer or laptop. Cartridge ink is very costly. You will get black cartridge at Rs 649 on Amazon and 899 for colour cartridge. My opinion is average for this product. But good product at this price.,0.5214285714285715,0.20238095238095236,pos

It stopped accepting paper. I've cleaned the feed roller behind the tray and the transfer roller accessible from behind, yet to no resolve.The canon onsite technician visited home to take a look. Tells me the problem is with the paper pickup assembly and not with the feed roller. Charged Rs. 650 in service fees without spending even 10 mins to check the printer. He said I should bring the printer to their service center but assembly related issues can rarely be fixed. Instead they may try to give me a replacement printer for a discount.The printer has no dust deposits outside or inside and has been used about 20 times so far for help with a 10 yo kids homework assignments and some photo prints. I only used original ink cartridges which were replaced once so far.I am writing this to help you decide whether owning a printer vs getting your prints from a print store nearby is a better option for you. I feel like unless you want to frequently (more than four time a week) need to take printouts without which your work cannot proceed, you should avoid owning a printer.--- Original review ---I am a veteran IT worker, have used numerous MFPs at work over the years. I always admired features such as duplex printing, ADF and scan to email in those huge expensive network printing machines.Now you can enjoy most of those features (and more) in home printers such as this one. The printer was fairly easy to setup, and I started printing over WiFi using my laptop AND my OnePlus phone, in no time at all. I also use the printer to help my nephew with his homework assignments and so far everything has been working great.I even took some prints for photo frames etc on glossy photo papers and those too turned out fabulous!The printer is well worth the money and the ink cartridges can last adequately if you take the time to learn how to use it properly.Quick tip 1 - The better the quality of printer media the better the print turns out. So make sure you use good quality paper when you expect the best quality print; whether for photos or regular document prints.Quick tip 2 - Make sure you know how to use photo editing software to get the exact size of print outs you really want. If you use A4 sized paper and mistakenly print a 4x6 with borderless printing, you will end up wasting a lot of ink, for a picture you may not use after all.",0.519806505223172,0.23912037037037034,pos

Your device and printer need to be connected to same wifi thats all.‚Ä¢The package was not well packed with bubble covers. However they kept brown paper of 1-2 meters in the amazon box along with the printer box.The piece is pucca and new. So the seller can be trusted.‚Ä¢Fax option is good for the price.‚Ä¢The print quality is good but takes lot of time to process and print it.‚Ä¢My previous canon printer process late and papers get jammed often. Same problem is seen here.‚Ä¢Cadrige and all stuffs are verywell packed. The cadridge can be refilled with syringe either by yourself or any local refill shop. But it runs out very quickly. Thats too bad for emergency uses. You should buy couple of cadridge as you never know when it'll run out. For me it hasn't even took 50 papers (of written documents) for full refilling.‚Ä¢my opinion : i regret buying this. Reading all good reviews i brought this crap. I honestly suggest you to not buy this.‚Ä¢No canon inkjet printers are useful for home purposes.,0.5300713012477719,0.1791978609625669,pos

Worked flawlessly over wifi on mac, iOS a d android devices.It takes a few tries to get the ADF scan to work well, set the paper guides correctly and it does a good job after that. If the correct size isn‚Äôt set via the guides, the sides could get chewed up and the scans would become angled.Dual side print worked well. Again, it‚Äôs important to get the setting of the paper width / guides at the right position. Once this is done, papers go in smoothly and get spit out well. Interesting, the prints come out in the reverse order, unlike other printers. If you‚Äôre someone who wants to read as it comes out, you may have to wait until the end.Canon has done a fairly good job coming up with a home printer with these features at this price point.

The printer was super easy to install. Took less than 5 minutes to download the app and set it up. Supports AirPrint so I can now easily print from my iPhone. Print quality is good and speed is okay ( faster than my previous hp printer but obviously not as fast as a laser printer). Offers auto duplex & auto document feeder making printing work so much easier and hassle free. Cannot comment right now on the economy of the cartridges, will have to update after a few months. However, one con of the printer is that canon has not supplied the manual. Only a few pages mentioning how to set up the printer have been supplied. What is the use of having a great feature full product if I don‚Äôt know how to use most of the functions! One has to download the detailed manual from their website.Edit (after 2 years usage): The printer ink is very costly and runs out after a few prints. Refuses to print black and white pages if the colour cartridge is running low (even with a completely new and full B&W cartridge). To top it off, ink cartridges are not easily available.",0.5211796536796538,0.30443722943722945,pos

Haven't had to use the LCD after the setup. Printing in draft mode is quick and uses less ink. The ink consumption is slightly on the higher side - not such a big deal since replacement cartridges are on the cheaper side. For higher volume printing, I would suggest going for a Brother monochrome laser printer which will be much quicker and with higher yield per toner cartridge.",0.39,0.2333333333333333,pos

Therefore, the only way to connect it is either using USB (non network mode), or using Wi-Fi. I am using the latter, and I have constant trouble in finding it on my LAN computers. Its almost useless for me now as a network printer. My suggestion would be to go for a wired LAN printer for anyone who needs a network printer. The scanner works and quality is ok, but works only when triggered from computer (I had to install NAPS32 software for this); one click scan from MFP didnt work. Haven't tried other functions, so cant say about those. For the build quality, its plastic and is poorly built (the trays have a lot of wobble), and paper alignment will therefore, always be a challenge. All in all, if you want something not too expensive, plan on using it without network connection at one location only, then this may work. If you want something that works on a network, and can take care of a home/ small office print/ scan/ copy needs, I wouldn't recommend it.",0.39259259259259255,-0.07222222222222224,pos

Papers get stuck or wrinkled or torn inside very frequently and then it becomes difficult to find the small pieces of paper which remain inside.

Now, compare that with a HP 4286, which is not anything fancy like this printer, but the cartridge is Rs.400-500 for 1300 pages for black, which is around 30p per page.So, be aware, if you want all that features and you don't mind spending more money every month, every time you print get this printer.

New catridge that came with printer hardly give 30pages i suppose and immediately the lights started blinking. I was told and read that they start blinking only when the ink is finished. So based on the reviews i got the catridges refilled with 400/- and the faced a lot of challenge in taking a test print. Finally i gave up and decided to call the Customer service 2 days later. And they advised me to visit the authorized branch in Hyderabad. After reaching there, they say that u lost warranty for refilling the catridge and you have to always buy new catridges whenever the lights start blinking. When enquired for the cost they said it will be around 1600 to 1700. I came back home and left the printer untouched for 2 days and gave a last attempt and to my surprise it started printing. So far i have taken around 70 prints. Again all 3 lights started blinking very often, removing catridges, placing it and restarting printer sometimes works and most of the times it irritates.Final verdit is:Better to go for an Ink Tank printer or a laser printer. Go for this printer if you can run for new catridges every now and then or deal with patience to get rid of the errors after a refill.I dont see a point buying the printer for 4800 and purchasing catridges worth 1600 after every 80 prints.",0.4807040998217469,0.15984848484848485,pos
